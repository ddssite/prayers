0 God, our Maker and Benefactor, 
You alone know the times and seasons of each person's life, 
foreseeing their words and deeds even before they have been accomplished. 
I know that nothing can befall me which You have not allowed for my salvation, if only I do not reject the Life that You so freely give to me. 
Enlighten my mind and thoughts with Your wisdom that I may choose rightly in the day(s) before me. 
Where I am mistaken, correct me, allowing me to learn from my errors. 
Where I stumble in sin, raise me up that I may serve You again in freedom and in joy. 
In my present life, let me grow in that awareness of Your presence where alone I find peace and fulfillment. 
When I am far from Your path, lead me back again. 
Let me hear each day of my life the voice of Your Word calling me into being and into the way of life, the words, the behavior and the deeds for which You have created me to fulfill, 
for Your glory and for my salvation. 
For to You belong all honor and glory, together with Your Son, the eternal Word of Life and Your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen. 

Another Prayer for Guidance 
Lord, I thank You for my entire being, my soul, my mind and my body, together with my freedom, my memory, my understanding and my will. All that I am and all that I have 
You have given to me, and I give all back to You to be used as You desire.  Come and abide within me. By the strength of Your presence and the joy of Your love, cast out the demons of sloth, despair, lust of power, idle talk and whatever else is the work of the Enemy.  Fill me then with the fullness of heaven and I shall desire nothing more. Amen.

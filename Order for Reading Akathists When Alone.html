<b>Trisagion Prayers</b><br><br>

Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee.<br><br>

<b>Psalm 50</b><br>
Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy steadfast love; according to Thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin! For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight, so that Thou are justified in Thy sentence and blameless in Thy judgment. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. Behold, Thou desire truth in the inward being, therefore, teach me wisdom in my secret heart. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice. Hide Thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me. Cast me not away from Thy presence and take not Thy holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and sinners will return to Thee. Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of Thy deliverance. O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise. For Thou hast no delight in sacrifice, were I to give a burnt offering, Thou would not be pleased. The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou will not despise. Do good to Zion in Thy good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem, then will Thou delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Thy altar.<br><br>
<b>Creed<br></b><br>
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Only-begotten, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light of Light; true God of true God; begotten, not made; of one essence with the Father, by Whom all things were made; Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from the heavens, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man; And was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered, and was buried; And arose again on the third day according to the Scriptures; And ascended into the heavens, and sits at the right hand of the Father; And shall come again, with glory, to judge both the living and the dead; Whose kingdom shall have no end. And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of Life; Who proceeds from the Father; Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spoke by the prophets. In One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, And the life of the age to come. Amen.<br><br>

<br><b>Ikos 1</b><br>
An angel in manner, though earthly by nature, did the Creator reveal thee to be, O most blessed Saint Nicholas. Having foresight into the fruitful beauty of thy soul, He taught all to cry unto thee thus:<br>

<br><b>Ikos 2</b><br>
Teaching incomprehensible knowledge about the Holy Trinity, thou was with the holy fathers in Nicaea as a champion of the confession of the Orthodox Faith.

<br><b>Ikos 3</b><br>

<br><b>Kontakion 4</b><br>
A storm of bewilderment confuses our minds. How can we worthily hymn thy wonders, O blessed Nicholas? No one could count them, even though he had many tongues and willed to tell them. Notwithstanding, we make bold to sing unto God Who is wonderfully glorified in thee: Alleluia.<br>

<br><b>Ikos 4</b><br>

<br><b>Ikos 5</b><br>
The maidens, prepared for a dishonorable marriage because of their poverty, beheld thy great compassion for the poor, most blessed Father Nicholas.

<br><b>Kontakion 7</b><br>
Desiring to dispel the blasphemous stench of heresy, thou didst appear as truly fragrant and mystical myrrh, Saint Nicholas.

Alleluia.<br>

<br><b>Ikos 7</b><br>

<br>Rejoice, Saint Nicholas, Great Wonderworker.<br>

<br><b>Kontakion 8</b><br>
A strange wonder is the sacred Church shewn to be unto those that flock to thee, O glorious Nicholas. By offering in it even a small supplication, we receive healing from hopeless illnesses, if only, after God, we place our hope in thee, faithfully crying aloud: Alleluia.<br>

<br><b>Ikos 8</b><br>

<br><b>Ikos 9</b><br>
The falsely theorizing orators of the ungodly, we see, were put to shame by thee, divinely wise Father Nicholas. Thou didst confute Arius the blasphemer who divided the Godhead, and Sabellius who mingled the Persons of the Holy Trinity, but thou hast strengthened us in Orthodoxy.

Desiring to save thy soul, thou didst truly crucify thy flesh to thy spirit, Father Nicholas. By silence and by wrestling with thoughts, thou didst add contemplation to conquest, and by meditation thou didst acquire perfect knowledge with which thou didst boldly converse with God and angels, always crying: Alleluia.<br>

<br><b>Ikos 10</b><br>
Thou art a rampart, most blessed Nicholas, unto those who praise thy miracles, and unto all who have recourse unto thine intercession. Free also us who are poor in virtue from pride, temptation, illness, and needs of various kinds, so that we may acceptably cry unto thee:<br>

<br><b>Ikos 11</b><br>
We see thee as a brilliant and inextinguishable ray for those in the darkness of this world, O God-chosen Father Nicholas.

<br><b>Ikos 12</b><br>
Whilst singing of thy wonders, we praise thee, O all-praised Nicholas, for in thee God Who is glorified in the Trinity is wondrously glorified.

<br>Rejoice, health of our bodies and salvation of our souls.
<br>Rejoice, through thee we are delivered from eternal death.
<br>Rejoice, through thee we are deemed worthy of everlasting life.
<br>Rejoice, Saint Nicholas, Great Wonderworker.<br>

<br><b>Kontakion 13</b> (read this Kontakion three times)<br>
Most holy and wonderful Father Nicholas, consolation of all who sorrow, do Thou accept our present offering. Entreat the Lord that we be delivered from Gehenna through thy God-pleasing intercession, so that with thee we may sing: Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.<br><br>

<br><b>A Prayer to St. Nicholas</b><br>
Saint Nicholas, thou art a wondrous helper unto all unfortunate people – the poor and the sorrowful, the young and the old, the fallen and the dispossessed, those who journey afar and those who are homebound with illnesses. Count us among the multitudes which entreat thy compassion, and nurture us with the bread of thy mercy. Though we are many, thou knowest the very heart of each one of us and thou knowest our needs. Deliver us, Saint Nicholas, from all things that lead unto death, and bless us with all things that please God. Since thou art a tireless worker of wonders, teach us to be repentant prodigals and fruitful vines for Christ our Lord and Master. We thank thee for thy bountiful nourishment and provision. Amen.

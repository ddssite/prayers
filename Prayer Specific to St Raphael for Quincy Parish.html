<b>Specific Prayer to St. Raphael for Quincy Parish</b>
<br>
<br>

O holy Father Raphael, as a servant of Christ, you traveled between the Eastern and Western coasts establishing Orthodox parishes for the scattered Orthodox people in America and devoted yourself to finding priests to care for their souls, we ask you to pray for us and to beseech our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to provide for the faithful of this Orthodox community the continued presence of a priest and follow your example of perseverance to continue building on the foundation of your many labors in service to the Lord and illumine Northeastern Missouri, Southeastern Iowa, and Western Illinois through a strong and fruitful parish that follows in your footsteps to search for the lost sheep, to be protecter of the poor, to be a haven for widows and orphans, and to be a worthy proclaimer of the Holy Gospel, so that we may all Rejoice to the Lord in unison with you, O Holy Father Raphael, and all the Saints: Alleluia!

<b>Specific Prayer to St. Raphael for Quincy Parish</b>
<br>
<br>
O holy Father Raphael, you, as a servant of Christ, who traveled between the Eastern and Western coasts establishing Orthodox parishes for the  scattered Orthodox people in this land of America and devoted yourself to finding priests to care for their souls, we ask you to pray for us and to beseech our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to provide for the faithful of this Orthodox community the continued presence of a priest and follow your example of perseverance to continue building on the foundation of your many labors in service to the Lord and illumine Northeastern Missouri, Southeastern Iowa, and Western Illinois through a strong and fruitful parish that follows in your footsteps to search for the lost sheep and to be protecter of the poor, to be a haven for widows and orphans, and be a worthy proclaimer of the Holy Gospel, so that we may all sing with Joy to the Lord in unison with you, O Holy Father Raphael, and all the Saints: Alleluia!

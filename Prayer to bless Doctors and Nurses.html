O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, Who during Your earthly sojourn went about doing good, and appeasing the sufferings and infirmities of the people, and restoring bodily and spiritual health to the Paralytic lying on his bed: 
<br><br>
Look upon the Doctors and Nurses, O Lord [especially _______ ] and let them become for the sick a means of relief from suffering.  Grant them wisdom and strength as they work to heal the sick. 
<br><br>
Bless them for their many hours of labor and study learning  the knowledge and skills to heal the sick by the talent You have given to each of them. Strengthen them to fear no evil or disease.
<br><br>
Preserve them in peace for You are our God and we know no other and to You we ascribe glory together with Your Father who is from everlasting and Your Most Holy good and life-creating Spirit, now and ever unto ages of ages. 
<br><br>
Amen.

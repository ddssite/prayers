<b>Prayer at the Use of the Internet</b><br>
O God, our Savior, Who was well pleased to guard the travels of Thy holy apostle Paul on the highways of the earth, and didst thereby bring the Gospel of salvation to a pagan world: do Thou Thyself now also preserve unharmed them that desire to venture upon the perilous network of our day.  Be Thou the guardian of our eyes and rational mind and preserve our spiritual heart in stillness all the days of our lives. <br> <br>

For unto Thee are due all glory, honor, and worship, together with Thy Father Who is without beginning, and Thy most-holy, good, and lifegiving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.  Amen. <br><br> 

<b>Troparion for St. John Chrysostom</b><br>
Grace shining forth from your mouth like a beacon has illumined the inhabited earth; it has disclosed to the world treasures which wealth cannot buy; and has set forth for us the height of humility. Instructing us by your words, O Father John Chrysostom, intercede with the Word, Christ God, that our souls may be saved.<br><br>

<b>Troparion for St Theophan the Recluse</b><br> 
O guide of Orthodoxy, teacher of piety and purity, ascetic of Vysha, divinely wise and holy hierarch Theophan: By your writings you explained the Word of God and showed the way of salvation unto all the faithful. Entreat Christ God that our souls may be saved.<br><br>


<b>Prayer after Use of the Internet</b><br>
O God, our Savior, Who didst make all things from nothing, return my eyes now to Thy true creation.  Thou, O Christ, art Thyself the fulfillment of all good things; fill my soul with joy and gladness, and save me, for Thou art all merciful and unto Thee are due all glory, honor, and worship, together with Thy Father Who is without beginning, and Thy most-holy, good, and lifegiving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages.  Amen. <br><br>

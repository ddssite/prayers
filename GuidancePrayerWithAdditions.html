<br>
0 God, our Maker and Benefactor, You alone know the times and seasons of each person's life, foreseeing their words and deeds even before they have been accomplished. <br><br>
I know that nothing can befall me which You have not allowed for my salvation, if only I do not reject the Life that You so freely give to me.<br> <br>
Enlighten my mind and thoughts with Your wisdom that I may choose rightly in the day(s) before me. <br><br>
Where I am mistaken, correct me, allowing me to learn from my errors. Where I stumble in sin, raise me up that I may serve You again in freedom and in joy. <br><br>
In my present life, let me grow in that awareness of Your presence where alone I find peace and fulfillment. <br><br>
When I am far from Your path, lead me back again. <br><br>
Heal the wounds of my soul and enlighten the eyes of my mind so that I may understand my place in Your eternal design.<br><br>
Because I have acknowledged You, O Lord, do you acknowledge me; have compassion on me, a sinner, who believes in You, for even if I sin, I still knock at Your door, even if I am sluggish, I still travel on Your road.<br><br>
Let me hear each day of my life the voice of Your Word calling me into being and into the way of life, the words, the behavior and the deeds for which You have created me to fulfill, to Your glory and for my salvation. <br><br>
I hope on Thy mercies, O Lord; I fall at Thy feet and beseech Thee: Grant me the spirit of repentance and lead my soul out of the dungeon of iniquity! May a ray of light shine in my mind before I go to the terrible judgement which awaits me, where there is no opportunity to repent of one's wicked deeds. <br><br>
The wall of my sins can be torn down only by tears and contrition; grant me all the days of my life to lament my sins and to gather the fruits which will serve me well in the day of judgement.<br><br>
For to You belong all honor and glory, together with Your Son, the eternal Word of Life and Your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen. <br><br>
<br>

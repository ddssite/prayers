You stood before the doors of the Church,
polluted with evil and unable to enter.
Accused by your own conscience, O wise one of God,
you converted to a better way of life.
Looking upon the icon of the blessed Mother of God,
you condemned all your past sins, O Mother Mary,//
and went to bow before the precious Cross.
<br><br>
Having worshipped at the holy places with great joy,
you received saving grace for your journey of virtue.
You set out in haste to follow the narrow path,
crossing the river Jordan, Mother Mary of Egypt, 
to live where St. John the Baptist and Forerunner had dwelt.
Through self-denial you tamed the savagery of the passions;
through violence you broke the rebellion of your flesh, 
taking the Kingdom of God by force.
<br><br>
You lived alone in the wilderness, Mother Mary of Egypt
and as you erased the images of sin from your soul,
God marked it with the imprint of holiness.
Filled with the spirit, O Blessed Mother,
you walked on the surface of the waters;
by your prayers you ascended from earth to heaven.
Since you stand before Christ, O glorious Mary, 
entreat Him with boldness to save our souls!
<br><br>
With the sword of abstinence,
you cut down the corrupt desires of your soul 
and the passions of your flesh.
With the silence of the wilderness 
you strangled your sinful words and thoughts.
You watered the desert with the streams of your tears,
and made the fruits of repentance to grow for us. 
We celebrate your memory, O holy one.
Again, I ask you to entreat Him with boldness to save our souls!
<br><br>
O Christ, The power of Your Cross has worked a wonder.
Through the Cross a harlot became a champion of the ascetic life.
Mary cast aside her weakness and bravely fought the devil,
and having won the prize of victory,  
she ceaselessly prays for our souls.
<br><br>
Tone 8	Troparion	St. Mary of Egypt
The image of God was truly preserved in you, O Mother,
for you took up the Cross and followed Christ.
By so doing, you taught us to disregard the flesh 
for it passes away;
but to care instead for the soul, for it is immortal. 
Therefore your spirit, O holy Mother Mary of Egypt,
rejoices with the angels.
<br><br>
Tone 3	Kontakion 
Having been a sinful woman,
you became through repentance a bride of Christ.
Having attained angelic life,
you defeated demons with the weapon of the Cross. 
Therefore, O most glorious St. Mary of Egypt, 
you are a bride of the Kingdom.

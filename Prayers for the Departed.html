O God of spirits and of all flesh, Who hast trampled down death and overthrown the Devil, and given life to Thy world, do Thou, the same Lord, give rest to the souls of Thy departed servants in a place of brightness, a place of refreshment, a place of repose, where all sickness, sighing, and sorrow have fled away. Pardon every transgression which they have committed, whether by word or deed or thought. For Thou art a good God and lovest mankind; because there is no man who lives yet does not sin, for Thou only art without sin, Thy righteousness is to all eternity, and Thy word is truth.
<br><br>
For Thou are the Resurrection, the Life, and the Repose of Thy servants who have fallen asleep, O Christ our God, and unto Thee we ascribe glory, together with Thy Father, who is from everlasting, and Thine all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now and ever unto ages of ages. Amen.

Lord our God, remember Your servant<i>(s)</i>, <br>
[list names:] ______________________________<br>
who now stand<i>(s)</i> before You in the faith and hope of eternal life. 
<br><br>
Release <i>him/her/them</i> from <i>his/her/their</i> sins, wipe away <i>his/her/their</i> iniquities; pardon, loose and free <i>him/her/them</i> from all <i>his/her/their</i> transgressions, voluntary and involuntary. Save <i>him/her/them</i> from the eternal suffering and fire of hell. Grant <i>him/her/them</i> to share in the eternal bliss which You have prepared for all who love You. 
<br><br>
Though <i>he/she/they</i> has <i>(have)</i> sinned, yet <i>he/she/they</i> has <i>(have)</i> not rejected You, and confessed faithfully even at <i>his/her/their</i> last breath<i>(s)</i> You, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, believing in God glorified in the holy Trinity, One in Three and Three in One, according to the Orthodox Faith. 
<br><br>
Bountiful One, be merciful to <i>him/her/them</i>, looking upon <i>his/her/their</i> faith rather than <i>his/her/their</i> works and grant <i>him/her/them</i> rest with all Your saints where there is no suffering, sickness, or sighing but rather eternal Life. 
<br><br>
For no one who lives is without sin; You alone are free from all stain and Your truth abides forever. You are the only merciful and gracious God, the Lover of mankind, and we ascribe glory to You, to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.

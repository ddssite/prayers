<b>Psalm 50</b>
<br><br>
Have mercy on me, O God,<br>
according to Thy steadfast love;<br>
according to Thy abundant mercy <br>
blot out my transgressions.<br>
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,<br>
and cleanse me from my sin!<br>
<br>
For I know my transgressions,<br>
and my sin is ever before me.<br>
Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned,<br>
and done that which is evil in Thy sight,<br>
so that Thou are justified in Thy sentence<br>
and blameless in Thy judgment.<br>
<br>
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,<br>
and in sin did my mother conceive me.<br>
Behold, Thou desire truth in the inward being;<br>
therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.<br>
<br>
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;<br>
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.<br>
Fill me with joy and gladness;<br>
let the bones which Thou hast broken rejoice.<br>
Hide Thy face from my sins,<br>
and blot out all my iniquities.<br>
<br>
Create in me a clean heart, O God,<br>
and put a new and right spirit within me.<br>
Cast me not away from Thy presence,<br>
and take not Thy holy Spirit from me.<br>
<br>
Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation,<br>
and uphold me with a willing spirit.<br>
Then I will teach transgressors Thy ways,<br>
and sinners will return to Thee.<br>
<br>
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God,<br>
the God of my salvation,<br>
and my tongue will sing aloud of Thy deliverance.<br>
O Lord, open Thou my lips,<br>
and my mouth shall show forth Thy praise.<br>
<br>
For Thou hast no delight in sacrifice;<br>
were I to give a burnt offering, Thou would not be pleased.<br>
The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit;<br>
a broken and contrite heart, O God, Thou will not despise.<br>
<br>
Do good to Zion in Thy good pleasure;<br>
rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,<br>
then will Thou delight in right sacrifices,<br>
in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings;<br>
then bulls will be offered on Thy altar.<br>
